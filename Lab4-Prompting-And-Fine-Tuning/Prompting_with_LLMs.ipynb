She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes each day is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. Next, we subtract the number of eggs she consumes from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. These 9 eggs are the ones she sells at the farmers\\' market. Since she sells each egg for $2, we calculate her daily earnings by multiplying the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18. Thus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers\\' market.\", \"answer\": \"18\"}'"
