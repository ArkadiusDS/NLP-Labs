In this case, we're setting max_length=256, meaning that if a piece of text is longer than 256 tokens, it will be truncated (cut off) at that length. This ensures the text fits within BERT's expected input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use padding?\n",
    "Some sentences or documents in the dataset may be shorter than 256 tokens. To ensure that all inputs to the model are the same length, we use padding. Padding adds extra tokens (usually with a value of 0) to the end of shorter sequences, so they all have the same number of tokens (256 in this case).\n",

    "What is max_length?\n",
    "The max_length=256 argument defines the maximum number of tokens for each input sequence.
